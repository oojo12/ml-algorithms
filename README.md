## This repository holds the following algorithms broken up by types
*if the __version__='done' then I am no longer working with on the algorithm because I am interested in attempting another or I feel it is complete enough*

### Clustering
- Kmeans - next updates will allow categorical feature handling and some error handling
- KNN - next updates will allow categorical feature handling and some error handling

### Neural Networks
- Multi-Layer Perceptron - will implement with value assertions
- Radial Basis Function Network - will implement with value assertions

### Reinforcement Learning algorithms
- Value Iteration - will implement with value assertions
- Policy Iteration - will implement with value assertions
- Markov Decision Process

### Reach algorithms
- tbd
